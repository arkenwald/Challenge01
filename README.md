# Challenge01

## Description

This project is for self-improvement and practice in order to provide myself with confidence within this industry.
Refactoring is a great skill to learn as it will apply in the real world.
This project helps improve the accesibility of the webpage to both the end-user and developer.
I've learned what a "div" soup is and how to alleviate this issue by modifying the non-semantic elements to semantic HTML elements.

## Installation

To install the project, I've created a repository on Github and cloned it locally.  Once the coding is finished locally, it was saved and pushed to the repository on Github.
